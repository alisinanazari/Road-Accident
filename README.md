Road Accident Analysis - Power BI Project
Overview
This project, Road Accident Analysis, is a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize road accident data. The aim is to provide insights into accident patterns, trends, and the factors that contribute to accidents, allowing stakeholders to identify areas for improvement in road safety.
With this dashboard, users can filter and view data based on various dimensions such as date, location, type of road, weather conditions, and casualty severity. It’s a powerful tool for traffic authorities, safety analysts, and decision-makers to make data-driven decisions to reduce road accidents and enhance road safety measures.
Dataset
The dataset, road_accident_data, contains real-world data on road accidents, which includes various fields such as:
•	Accident Index: A unique identifier for each accident record.
•	Local: The location or area where the accident occurred.
•	Accident Date & Time: The exact date and time of the accident.
•	Day of the Week: The day the accident happened.
•	Police Force: The police force area responsible for the location.
•	Number of Casualties: The total number of casualties in each accident.
•	Junction Control & Junction Detail: Details about the junction and its control measures, if applicable.
•	Carriageway Hazards: Hazards present on the road at the time of the accident.
•	Road Surface Conditions: Surface conditions (e.g., wet, dry) at the time of the accident.
•	Road Type: The type of road where the accident took place (e.g., single carriageway, dual carriageway).
•	Speed Limit: The speed limit at the accident location.
Each field provides valuable information to understand and analyze the contributing factors to road accidents.
Key Metrics
The dashboard includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs):
1.	Total Accidents: Total number of accidents within the selected period.
2.	Total Casualties: Total number of casualties resulting from these accidents.
3.	Fatal, Serious, and Slight Casualties: Breakdown of casualties by severity.
4.	Year-over-Year Comparison: Comparison of key metrics (e.g., accidents, casualties) with previous years.
5.	Accidents by Road Type: Distribution of accidents based on road types.
6.	Casualties by Day of the Week: Analysis of casualty numbers by day to identify high-risk days.
Features
The Road Accident Analysis dashboard provides:
•	Interactive Filters: Allows users to filter data by date, time, location, road type, and more.
•	Trend Analysis: Yearly and monthly trends to help identify accident patterns over time.
•	Comparative Analysis: Year-over-year and month-over-month comparisons of accident and casualty numbers.
•	Geographic Visualization: Map visuals to show accident hotspots by location.
•	Detailed Drill-downs: The ability to drill down by various dimensions like accident type, casualty severity, road surface conditions, and speed limits.
Technical Approach
The project leverages several DAX functions and Power BI features to analyze and present the data, including:
•	Time Intelligence Functions: Functions like SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR, PREVIOUSYEAR, and DATEADD are used to analyze data over time.
•	Calculated Columns and Measures: Custom measures are created to calculate total casualties, fatal injuries, and serious injuries, as well as year-over-year comparisons.
•	Custom Visualizations: Standard Power BI visuals are customized with colors, tooltips, and conditional formatting to enhance readability.
•	Data Modeling: A custom calendar table is created to ensure a continuous date range, enabling accurate time-based analysis.
Usage
1.	Clone or Download the project repository from GitHub.
2.	Open the Power BI file (road_accident_analysis.pbix) in Power BI Desktop.
3.	Connect to the Dataset: Load the provided data file or update the dataset path if required.
4.	Explore the Dashboard:
o	Use the filters on the right panel to narrow down the analysis by date, location, and other parameters.
o	Interact with the visuals by clicking on different data points to see detailed breakdowns and drill-through options.
o	Hover over visuals to view additional data insights via tooltips.
Sample Insights
Some insights you may discover using this dashboard:
•	Accident Hotspots: Identify locations with a high number of accidents, enabling focused safety measures.
•	Time-Based Trends: Discover peak accident times during the day and days of the week.
•	Road Surface Conditions Impact: Determine how road surface conditions (e.g., wet, icy) influence accident severity.
•	Impact of Speed Limits: Analyze how speed limits correlate with accident frequency and casualty severity.
Future Improvements
Planned improvements for this dashboard include:
•	Advanced Machine Learning Integration: Predictive analytics to forecast future accident trends based on historical data.
•	Real-time Data Integration: Incorporate real-time data streams for live updates on accident hotspots.
•	Deeper Demographic Analysis: Adding demographic data to analyze age, gender, and other factors affecting accident rates.
